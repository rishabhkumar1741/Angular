## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

## Interview Question

### Q: What is the difference between a property and a variable in Angular?
```
 In Angular, a variable is declared inside a method and is used only within that scope. A property, on the other hand, is declared in the class and is accessible throughout the class and also in the template via data binding. We typically use properties to pass data between the component and the view.

 ngOnInit() {
  let count = 5; // local variable
}

 export class AppComponent {
  title: string = 'My Angular App'; // property
}
```

### Q:   Whatâ€™s the difference between dependencies and devDependencies in Angular?
````
dependencies are needed to run the app in production, like @angular/core or rxjs. devDependencies are only needed during development or testing, like @angular/cli or typescript.
````
### Q: Q: What is interpolation in Angular?
ðŸ”¹ What is Interpolation?
Interpolation in Angular is used to display data from the component class to the template (HTML).

Itâ€™s done using double curly braces {{ }}.

```
# In app.component.ts

export class AppComponent {
  name: string = 'Rishabh';
}

# In app.component.html
<h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>

```
